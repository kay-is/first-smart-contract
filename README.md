# Fundraiser Example

This is the fundraiser example from the book "Hands-on Smart Contract Development with Ethereum".

Instead of JavaScript, Truffle, and Ganache, it uses TypeScript and Hardhat.

## Commands

- `npm run build` to build the smart contracts
- `npm run test` to run the unit tests
- `npm run node` to start a local Hardhat network
- `npm run deploy` to deploy to the local Hardhat network
- `npm run test:localhost` to run the tests on the local Hardhat network
- `npm run client` to run the web client
